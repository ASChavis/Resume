    <h3>Welcome!</h3>

        <p class="intro">
            I have started learning how to code over the last year or so.
        I am hoping to emerge into a career in software development. Over the last 10 years,
        I was dedicated, heart and soul, to Veterinary Medicine. It's no secret that I love animals.
        My career change was prompted when I had my second child in 2021. I began studying online with The 
        Odin Project in 2022. I am currently studying through an online bootcamp. Veterinary medicine will 
        always have a special place in my heart. My motiviation for the change of profession is to provide a 
        better life for my entire family, including my pets.

    <h3>About me</h3>

        <p class="aboutMe">
            I am fortunate to have a rather large family! My husband's name is Camby. He is my rock.
        Together, we have two wonderful children, Abigail and Oliver. We have two older dogs, Sunny 
        and Bailey. We also have two mischevious cats, Bones and Necronomicat. It would be an understatment to say
        that I love my family. On the weekends, we will often spend time together outdoors at local parks or visiting relatives.
        I currently spend most of my time tending to the various needs of the family. In my spare time, 
        I enjoy knitting, gardening, doing construction projects around the house, watching cooking shows, playing games, and spending 
        time with my family. I am hoping to start caring for our local stray population over the next few years. I would like to 
        start volunteering to help the local rescues treat sick patients. I have previously volunteered at organizations
        such as Riverbanks Zoo and Garden (Cat/Bear department) and Carolina Wildlife Care. I will always help however I can.
        </p>
